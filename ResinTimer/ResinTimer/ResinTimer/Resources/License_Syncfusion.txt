subject to interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) annually, or the maximum amount allowed by applicable
law if lower, calculated from the date when payment was due until payment is made. In addition, Customer agrees

4.
License Grant:
4.1
Syncfusion hereby grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to the Licensed
Product, for use on a specific Platform, solely for the purpose of developing Customer products. For the avoidance
of doubt, Customer agrees that the Licensed Product is licensed and not sold. All use of the Licensed Program(s)
by Customer shall be made solely in accordance with the Documentation.
4.2
All licenses are subject to the following limitations:
(a) The Licensed Product shall be used only by Customer for Customer’s sole and exclusive benefit, and shall not
be used to provide time-sharing or other similar services.
(b) Customer shall not transfer, distribute, or sublicense the Licensed Product to any third parties, and Customer’s
license shall automatically terminate in the event of such a transfer or distribution.
(c) Customer shall not lease or lend the Licensed Program(s) or otherwise allow use of the Licensed Program(s) by
or on behalf of any third party (including any Customer third-party contractor), nor describe the results of any
benchmarking of the Licensed Program(s), whether or not obtained with Syncfusion’s assistance, to any third
party. Customer cannot use a third-party contractor to use the licenses on behalf of the Customer. A breach of
this section is a material breach of the agreement and will result in immediate termination of all Customer’s
license rights.
(d) Syncfusion strongly recommends that Customer should not combine the Licensed Program(s) with other software
licensed by Customer from any third parties if such third party software is substantially similar to that of the
Licensed Program(s). Such use of third party software may create technical difficulties, including without
limitation interoperability difficulties; therefore, any such use of third party software is at Customer’s discretion
and customer shall bear any and all liability that may arise from such use.
(e) Customer may not use the Licensed Program(s) in such a way that results in Customer’s development of software
products that are directly or indirectly competitive with the Licensed Product or any other Syncfusion products.
In addition, Customer’s use of the Licensed Program(s) must be for the purpose of developing Customer products
that include significant value-added features. The Licensed Program(s) may not be used to create
frameworks/controls/wrappers or other such products that are intended to be programmatically reused by anyone.
Customer acknowledges that any breach of this Section 4.2(e) or Section 4.2(i) will constitute a material breach
of this Agreement and will result in an immediate termination of the license granted hereunder. Subject to the
limitations of Section 4.2(f), Customer represents and warrants that (1) Customer’s limited right to re-distribute
retail/release builds of Syncfusion libraries along with Customer’s product(s) is permitted only so long as the
Syncfusion libraries are not directly accessible for use within Customer’s product(s) and/or outside of it, and that
(2) such Customer product(s) are not deployed in a server environment (except as allowed under Section 4.2(h)

of this Agreement) (3) and all other terms and conditions of this Agreement have been met. No other part of the
Licensed Product or Licensed Program may be re-distributed by Customer.
Subject to Customer’s compliance with all of the limitations of this Agreement, a Customer operating under a
Retail License may re-distribute retail/release builds of Syncfusion libraries as incorporated in Customer’s
product(s) only so long as all modified binaries that are incorporated in such Customer products that were created
while Customer is under a valid Maintenance and Support services subscription. Customer acknowledges and
agrees that any re-distribution of any such modified binaries created when Customer is not under a valid
Maintenance and Support services subscription will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will result
in an immediate termination of the license granted hereunder. Customers with Retail Licenses may re-distribute
Licensed Assemblies in a Customer’s product if all of the terms of this Agreement are followed and so long as
(i) Customer ensures that such Licensed Assemblies include license checks that prevent the use of the Licensed
Assemblies for development purposes when such Licensed Assemblies are redistributed as part of Customer’s
products, and (ii) Customer represents and warrants to Syncfusion that Customer’s products do not infringe upon
any proprietary rights of any third parties, including without limitation patent rights. Customer’s re-distribution
of Syncfusion libraries as part of Customer products is without royalty to Syncfusion.
Customer’s right to deploy, evaluate, and use the Licensed Programs may be further limited based on the Platform
for which a given Licensed Program is licensed. In the event that such use is to be limited to a specific Platform,
the allowed Platform(s) will be set forth in the invoice provided to you by Syncfusion.
4.2.g.1 A license for Essential® Studio Enterprise Edition (which includes User Interface Edition, Reporting
Edition, and Business Intelligence Edition) includes the right to use all of the Licensed Programs on
the Platform designated in the Syncfusion invoice.
4.2.g.2 A license for Essential® Studio User Interface Edition, or Reporting Edition, or Business Intelligence
Edition includes the right to use the specified edition on the Platform designated in the Syncfusion
invoice.
4.2.g.3 A license for any given Essential® product, such as Essential® Tools, includes the right to use that
specific Licensed Program on the Platform designated in the Syncfusion invoice.
4.2.g.4 Any use of a Licensed Program on a Platform not so designated is deemed a material breach of your
obligations under this Agreement and may result in termination of your licensed rights and/or your
Maintenance and Support subscription at Syncfusion’s sole discretion.
Retail/release builds of the Licensed Products that are designed for operation under server environments may be
installed in server environments such as Microsoft ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, and Silverlight, subject to the
specific conditions of this Section 4.2(h) and this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, a “server” or “server
environment” includes physical hardware servers located on Customer’s premises or in a hosted environment or
in a cloud environment, whether or not the physical server is a dedicated machine or a virtual server installation.
Schedule A sets forth a complete list of the deployment licenses that are included at no additional cost with each
Licensed Product. In the event that Customer chooses to install one or more of the Licensed Products on a server,
Customer shall ensure that only Customer’s products, and no third party software programs, are able to create
and use the Syncfusion libraries contained therein. Customer warrants that such libraries shall not be used for
any software development purposes whatsoever. Customer acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this
Section 4.2(h) will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will result in an immediate termination of
the license granted hereunder.
Customer acknowledges and agrees that there are additional limitations on making copies of the Licensed
Product.
4.2.i.1 Subject to the limitations of this Agreement, Customer may make multiple copies of the Licensed
Product, so long as Customer includes all Syncfusion proprietary rights notices on such copies.
However, such multiple copies are for the exclusive use of a single End-User and are only allowed for
the convenience of such End-User to work on more than one computer system non-simultaneously.
Customer acknowledges and agrees no copies of the Licensed Product are transferrable between EndUsers.

ESSENTIAL STUDIO SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
4.2.i.2 Subject to the limitations of this Agreement, Customer must ensure that each individual End-User has
an assigned copy of the Licensed Product. Each user that is building Customer products that rely on
or use the Licensed Product in any manner are required to have an assigned copy of the Licensed
Product. Customer further agrees that it must ensure that it has an adequate number of licensed copies
of each Licensed Program; specifically, Customer represents and warrants that it has obtained a copy
of the Licensed Program for each individual that writes software applications that create code, use,
work with, or test software applications that incorporate the Licensed Program(s), including without
limitation testers that test software applications written with the Licensed Program with the aid of a
scripting environment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, testers that test applications manually (without
the aid of tools such as a scripting environment) are not required to have a copy of the Licensed
Program. For the avoidance of doubt, such testers shall be exempt only if they have not performed any
role during the development of any part of the application and are simply involved in final manual
testing as an end. Syncfusion retains the right to request, and Customer is required to provide no later
than thirty (30) days from the date of Syncfusion’s initial request, reasonable assurances of Customer’s
compliance with the terms of this Section 4.2.i.2. Such assurances should include, but not be limited
to, information that accurately supports the full scope of Customer’s use of the Licensed Product,
including (1) the name of Customer’s products (software application(s) or software development(s))
that link to or are dependent upon the Licensed Product, (2) the location of the premises where such
Customer products are developed, (3) the means by which Customer’s software teams obtained and
share copies of the Licensed Products, and (4) the size of the team (an actual physical count of all
individual members of such team) working on each software application or development that
incorporates or is linked to the Licensed Product. Syncfusion reserves the right to request additional
information, and Customer shall provide such additional information, that Syncfusion believes at its
discretion is necessary to make such reasonable assurances accurate and complete. For the avoidance
of doubt, the information requested herein does not constitute an audit of Customer’s environment or
operations by Syncfusion. Moreover, all information disclosed to Syncfusion by Customer shall be
governed by the confidentiality terms of this Agreement (Section 11 Confidentiality and Proprietary
Rights), and no other agreement shall be required or applicable with respect to the protection of such
Customer information.
4.2.i.3 In the event that Customer uses a dedicated build machine to build Customer’s products, Customer
does not need to have a separate copy of the Licensed Product assigned to the dedicated build machine,
but rather may use a copy of the Licensed Product assigned to the primary user of the dedicated build
machine. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer agrees that in order for a given computer to constitute
a dedicated build machine, such computer must contain no software other than Customer’s product and
those portions of the Licensed Programs included with Customer’s product, and such computer may
not be used for developing software products that use the Licensed Product.
4.2.i.4 No internal transfer of any copies of the Licensed Program from one individual End-User to another is
permitted except with the express written permission of Syncfusion, which may be withheld in
Syncfusion’s sole discretion. Permission for internal transfers will not be granted under any
circumstances if Customer is not under a valid Maintenance and Support services subscription at the
time of (and the period immediately after) the Customer request.
4.2.i.5 Syncfusion will, in its sole discretion, make the final determination as to the number of copies of the
Licensed Product that Customer must license in order to provide adequate copies for Customer’s
personnel and authorized subcontractors. Syncfusion will make allowances for testers and will not
count computers that constitute dedicated build machines.
4.2.i.6 Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 4.2.i.2 and the requirement of Section 4.2.i.4, Syncfusion
may allow Customer to have all or some subset of Customer’s properly licensed copies of the Licensed
Product designated as “floating copies” that are not dedicated to any specific End-User; however,
Customer must first agree to pay a premium license fee for the right to so designate such floating copies
and sign a written agreement to that effect. Syncfusion reserves the right to grant this special right in
its sole discretion.

4.2.i.7 Customer acknowledges that any breach of this Section 4.2(i) shall constitute a material breach of this
Agreement and will result in an immediate termination of the license granted hereunder.
(j) The Licensed Programs are available individually, each of which is set forth on Schedule B to this Agreement,
and as part of a suite branded as an edition of Essential® Studio (currently available in Enterprise Edition, User
Interface Edition, Reporting Edition, and Business Intelligence Edition). In the event that Customer’s license
hereunder is limited to one or more individual Licensed Programs, Customer may still elect to install one of the
available editions of Essential® Studio as set forth in this Section 4.2(j). Customer acknowledges and agrees
that Customer’s installation of one of the available editions of Essential® Studio (rather than just the individually
Licensed Programs) is deemed to be acceptance of the following additional limitations:
4.2.j.1 Customer may use the controls/frameworks included with those Licensed Programs for which it
possesses a valid license for commercial development and redistribution purposes as set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement; and
4.2.j.2 Customer may use the controls/frameworks included with all other Licensed Programs included in the
edition of Essential® Studio that Customer installs, but only for internal evaluation purposes and for
no other purpose; and
4.2.j.3 Customer’s use of the controls/frameworks for which it does not possess a valid license, for other than
for internal evaluation purposes, shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement; and
4.2.j.4 Maintenance and Support services are not provided for Licensed Programs for which Customer does
not possess a valid, fully paid-up commercial development license.
(k) Retail Licenses: Syncfusion generally makes the Licensed Programs available to its smaller customers on a percopy basis for a single copy or a small number of copies, which are referred to as “Retail Licenses”. Retail
Licenses will only made available to Customer in Syncfusion’s sole discretion and only when the number of such
End-Users is finite and readily ascertainable. Accordingly, Syncfusion will make a determination as to whether
or not the provision of Retail Licenses is appropriate under the circumstances applicable to any given Customer,
and reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to refuse to make available Retail Licenses to a Customer and instead
require a given Customer to procure a site license, project license, division license, or global license as
circumstances dictate.
(l) Community Licenses are subject to the further restrictions set forth in this Section 4.2(l).
4.2.l.1 Community Licenses are not available to any government agency or any quasi-government agency
regardless of the size of such agency or its budget.
4.2.l.2 Community Licenses may be used by individual End-Users for any legal purpose, including
commercial use, subject to each limitation set forth in this Agreement. Individual End-Users may not
use any Licensed Product licensed under the Community License on behalf of any entity or
organization unless the entity or organization would itself qualify for Community Licenses under the
financial test set forth below.
4.2.l.3 In order to qualify for a Community License, an entity or other organization must meet all of the
following requirements:
4.2.l.3.1 An entity or organization must have gross annual revenues of less than one million United
States dollars (USD $1,000,000), or equivalent in foreign currency, during each year that Customer
desires to remain a licensee under a Community License. Syncfusion reserves the sole right to make
a final determination as to whether Customer shall initially qualify for, and subsequently maintain,
the right to hold a Community License. For the purpose of determining and maintaining eligibility
for a Community License, there shall be absolutely no exceptions made when determining gross
annual revenues. If an entity or organization is controlled by another entity or organization, the
controlling entity or organization must also meet the gross annual revenue requirement when
aggregating all such entities owned or controlled by the parent entity or organization. Community
Licenses can also be used by non-profit organizations with an annual total budget of less than one
million United States dollars (USD $1,000,000) or equivalent in foreign currency.

4.2.l.3.2 An entity organization may not have more than five (5) total developer End Users. No entity
or organization may hold more than five (5) Community Licenses at any given point in time. Holding
more than five (5) Community Licenses at any point in time will automatically make the entity or
organization ineligible for Community Licenses from that point forward, and the entity or
organization shall remain ineligible even if the number of Community Licenses should subsequently
fall back under this numerical limit.
4.2.l.4 Syncfusion reserves the right to request, and Customer shall promptly provide, all reasonable
cooperation to verify Customer’s eligibility for obtaining and/or maintaining Community Licenses,
including access to validating documentation as needed.
4.2.l.5 Community Licenses are non-transferable under any and all circumstances.
4.2.l.6 Syncfusion does allow non-University level classrooms use Syncfusion’s community license, for
classroom educational instruction only, so long as they notify Syncfusion and do not use Syncfusion
in any commercial applications.
4.2.l.7 Customer cannot use Community Licenses to provide services on behalf of another entity or
organization unless the entity or organization to which the service is provided is also eligible for
Community Licenses under the terms set forth herein.
4.2.l.8 Community Licenses do not require renewals as the license will continue to be valid perpetually so
long as the Customer continues to be eligible to hold a Community License under the terms of this
Section 4.2.l.
4.2.l.9 If Customer becomes ineligible as set forth herein to continue as a licensee under a Community
License, Customer shall immediately notify Syncfusion of such occurrence and upgrade to a standard
commercial license (whether a Retail License, site license, project license, division license, or global
license as circumstances dictate). Failure to notify Syncfusion within sixty (60) days of eligibility
constitutes a material breach of the Agreement.
4.2.l.10 Community Licenses never include access to source code editions of the Licensed Product. Customers
that desire a source code edition of a Licensed Product must upgrade to a standard commercial license.
4.2.l.11 The Licensed Product licensed under the Community License is provided “as is”, without warranty of
any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for
a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall Syncfusion be liable for any claim,
damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or
in connection with the Licensed Product or the use or other dealings in the Licensed Product when
licensed under a Community License.
4.2.l.12 The version of the Licensed Product made available as a Community License may be referred to as the
Essential® Studio Enterprise – Community Edition, or Syncfusion may simply indicate that the
Licensed Product is provided under a Community License when licensed to You under the Community
License terms of this Section 4.2.l.
4.2.l.13 Syncfusion reserves all rights and shall be solely able to determine the eligibility for any Customer to
obtain and hold a Community License. In the event an individual or organization is found to be
ineligible, such individuals or organizations shall immediately cease use of the Community License or
upgrade to a commercial license.
(m) Electronic Delivery. All Licensed Programs and Documentation shall be delivered by electronic means unless
otherwise specified in a separate written agreement. A Licensed Program shall be deemed to have been delivered
when it is made available to Customer for download.
(n) Syncfusion reserves all rights to the Licensed Product not specifically granted herein.
4.3
Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Licensed Program contains certain features that allow Customer
to develop Customer products that implement different versions of the Microsoft® Office User Interface and/or similar
interfaces. Customer acknowledges and agrees that such features shall not be used by Customer under any
circumstance unless Customer obtains a license for the relevant Microsoft® Office User Interface directly from
Microsoft. Customer further acknowledges and agrees that the Licensed Product may contain optional components

that are licensed under the MIT/BSD License or similar open source licenses. Accordingly, Customer explicitly
acknowledges and hereby agrees that it is solely responsible for obtaining any necessary third party licenses and for
operating in compliance with any such third party licenses if Customer chooses to use any such optional third party
software components. Further information regarding such third party licenses is available in Schedule D (Third
Party Licenses and Attributions).
4.4
Syncfusion provides access to the open programming extension (“OPX”);. OPX does not require you to be
a customer of Syncfusion’s. OPX is a separate download, a separate install, and is not part of Syncfusion Essential
Studio. OPX requires an independent download and install, and use of OPX is not governed by this Agreement.
Access to OPX files is provided to you for reference only and is provided “as-is” and without any warranty or
indemnification of any kind. Accordingly, Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer shall remain solely
liable for any claims that may arise from Customer’s use of OPX, regardless of whether such claims arise alone or in
connection with any other products provided by Syncfusion. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer hereby
acknowledges and agrees that Syncfusion shall have no liability to Customer whatsoever under any circumstances
related to OPX. OPX may contain GPL; Syncfusion makes no representations or warranties and does not provide
indemnification regarding OPX licenses.
4.5
Syncfusion provides optional samples of code created with the Licensed Product; however, such optional
samples of code are not part of Syncfusion’s Licensed Products and are only made available for the purpose of
demonstration. Syncfusion does not provide products shown in the sample other than the Licensed Product and does
not provide a warranty or indemnity of any kind related in any way to such sample code. Syncfusion does not provide
indemnification for any optional sample code. Syncfusion does not provide endorsement of any kind to any product
or technology shown in the optional sample code.
5.
Title: No title to or ownership in the Licensed Product is transferred to Customer. Title to and all applicable
rights in patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets in the Licensed Product shall remain in Syncfusion or third
parties from whom Syncfusion has obtained rights to license the Licensed Product. The Licensed Product provided
hereunder, including the ideas, concepts, know-how, and technology contained therein, is proprietary and confidential
to and contains trade secrets of Syncfusion and its Vendors, and Customer agrees to be bound by and observe the
proprietary, confidential, and trade secret nature thereof as herein provided. Customer agrees to take appropriate
action by instruction or agreement with its employees who are permitted access to the Licensed Product to fulfill its
obligations hereunder. Except as may be permitted in writing by Syncfusion, Customer shall not provide, or
otherwise make available, the Licensed Product or copies thereof to any third party.
6.
Term and Termination:
6.1 Subject to the limitations of the Agreement, and so long as the term of this Agreement is continuous and has
never been terminated, the term of the rights licensed under this Agreement with regard to the continued distribution
of compiled binaries created by Customer that (i) incorporate or depend on the Licensed Product, and (ii) were
created while under a valid Maintenance and Support services subscription, and (iii) do not and have not violated the
limitations of Section 4.2(f) is perpetual. However, Customer’s right to any create modified binaries that are
incorporated in Customer’s products is term-limited to the period of time that Customer is under a valid Maintenance
and Support services subscription, as further set forth in detail in Section 4.2(f). Maintenance and Support services
subscriptions under Section 10 are generally limited in duration to one (1) year, subject to renewal at Syncfusion’s
sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer acknowledges and agrees that the only portion of the rights
licensed hereunder that is perpetual is the limited right to re-distribute the compiled binaries that were incorporated
in Customer’s product and that were created when all modified binaries were created under a valid Maintenance and
Support services subscription.
6.2 Syncfusion shall have the right to terminate Customer’s license if Customer fails to pay any required license
fee(s) or otherwise fails to comply with the license terms and conditions set forth herein.
(a) In the event that Customer’s failure to comply is not payment-related, Syncfusion shall give written notice to
Customer of such default, and if such default has not been remedied within thirty (30) days after such notice, the
license granted hereunder shall terminate.
(b) In the event that Customer has failed to pay any required fee(s), whether an initial license fee or fee for additional
licenses, maintenance, subscriptions, or any other services, Syncfusion shall give written notice to Customer of

such default, and if such default has not been remedied in full within five (5) days of such notice, all licenses
granted hereunder are hereby automatically revoked without further notice. Once any licenses are revoked for
failure to pay license fees, all redistribution of the Licensed Product, including under prior agreements, shall be
strictly prohibited. Syncfusion shall not be required to give any written notice in the event that Customer’s
material breach of this Agreement results in the immediate termination of the license granted under this
Agreement.
6.3 Customer agrees that it shall, upon (i) expiration of this Agreement or (ii) upon termination of the licenses
granted hereunder by Syncfusion due to Customer’s default or material breach of the terms of this Agreement or (iii)
upon expiration or termination of any project, site, division, or global license, Customer shall immediately return or
destroy the Licensed Program(s) and copies thereof as directed by Syncfusion and, if requested by Syncfusion, to
certify in writing as to the destruction or return of the Licensed Product and all copies thereof.
6.4 Syncfusion agrees that any expiration of this Agreement shall not affect Customer’s right to re-distribute
Licensed Assemblies so long as: (i) such Licensed Assemblies were incorporated into Customer’s products prior to
the expiration or breach of the licenses granted hereunder, and (ii) so long as Customer’s products were distributed
for external use (i.e. by Customer to individuals outside of Customer’s organization, subsidiaries, and affiliates) prior
to any such expiration of termination of the Agreement, and (iii) so long as Customer was under a valid Maintenance
and Support service subscription in compliance with the limitations of Section 4.2(f).
6.5 Customer acknowledges and agrees that in the event of the termination of this Agreement, Customer will no
longer have the right to possess the Licensed Assemblies, and subsequently cannot distribute any software code or
application that includes the Licensed Product. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that an
improper re-distribution of the Licensed Assemblies or Licensed Products (as incorporated into a Customer product)
shall not under any circumstance permit or excuse any subsequent re-distribution. An improper re-distribution
includes, but is not limited to, a re-distribution that occurs after the expiration or termination of this Agreement,
whether due to Customer’s breach due to unlicensed or under-licensed use of the Licensed Product or failure to
maintain a Maintenance and Support Services subscription, or otherwise. Additionally, Customer acknowledges and
agrees that upon termination of this Agreement, Customer will remove all Licensed Products and Licensed
Assemblies from any Customer product or other software that is used internally within Customer’s organization
(including that of its subsidiaries and affiliates).
6.6 Customer acknowledges and agrees that any of the following actions are deemed material breaches of this
Agreement: (i) creating or modifying any binaries that are incorporated in a Customer product while Customer is not
under a valid Maintenance and Support services subscription; or (ii) re-distributing any Customer product or other
software that include any modified binaries in any part of the Customer product (or other software) that incorporates
Syncfusion Licensed Products if created at a time when Customer was not under a valid Maintenance and Support
services subscription. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer acknowledges and agrees that it may not make any
changes, fix any bugs, create any new versions, or otherwise modify any Customer product that includes or depends
on the Licensed Product unless Customer is currently operating under a valid Maintenance and Support services
subscription.
6.7 Sections 5, 7.2, 9, 11, 16, and 17 of this Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of Customer’s
license and this Agreement.

Warranty:
7.1
Upon installation on the Computer System, the Licensed Program(s) will perform in all material respects in
accordance with the specifications in the Documentation for a period of sixty (60) days. Customer’s sole remedy for
any defect in the Licensed Program(s), the specific details of which having been communicated to Syncfusion within
the foregoing warranty period, shall be to terminate this Agreement in the event that Syncfusion fails to cure such
defect within forty-five (45) days after Syncfusion has received written notice from Customer. However, such written
notice must specify the nature of such defect in detail sufficient for Syncfusion to address and remedy the claimed
defect. Any modification or attempted modification of the Licensed Product by Customer or any failure by Customer
to implement any improvements or updates to the Licensed Product as supplied by Syncfusion shall void this

warranty. Syncfusion shall not be responsible for any defect in, or any defect caused by, any additions or
modifications to the Licensed Product by Customer.
7.2
THE ABOVE WARRANTIES ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
OR STATUTORY; WHICH WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
8.
Patent and Copyright Indemnification: Subject to the limitation of liability set forth in Section 9 below,
Syncfusion shall defend any action, suit, or proceeding brought against Customer insofar as it is based on a claim that
the Licensed Product delivered hereunder infringes any United States copyright. However, and subject to the
limitation of liability set forth in Section 9 below, Syncfusion’s indemnity hereunder does not extend to any claims
of infringement or misappropriation of any patent, trade secret, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, unless
otherwise set forth in an addendum to this Agreement and such addendum is signed by both parties. Customer
acknowledges and agrees that the only entity that can be liable for indemnification under this Agreement is
Syncfusion. Indemnification hereunder shall be contingent upon Customer providing prompt notice of such claim in
writing, and upon Customer granting Syncfusion full authority, information, and assistance (at Syncfusion’s expense,
up to the limitation of liability) for the defense of such claim. Subject to the limitation of liability, Syncfusion shall
pay all damages and costs finally awarded therein against Customer, subject to the limitation of liability of Section
9.2, following the final resolution of any such claims before a court of competent jurisdiction, but shall not be
responsible for any compromise made without its consent. Syncfusion may, at its option and expense, (a) replace or
modify the Licensed Product so that infringement will not exist or (b) refund to Customer prepaid License Fees on a
pro-rata basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Syncfusion’s indemnification hereunder shall not extend to any
infringement or claim thereof which is based upon (i) the combination of the Licensed Product delivered hereunder
with any software or device not supplied by Syncfusion; (ii) any specifications provided to Syncfusion by Customer;
or (iii) modifications to the Licensed Product not performed by Syncfusion.
9.
Use of Licensed Program(s) and Limitation of Liability:
9.1
The Licensed Program(s) are tools that are not intended to replace the professional skills and judgment of
Customer and its employees, agents and consultants. Customer alone shall be responsible for the accuracy and
adequacy of information and data furnished for processing and any use made by Customer of the output of the
Licensed Program or any reliance thereon by Customer or users of Customer products. Customer shall also be
responsible for the continued operation and maintenance of the computer equipment and the third-party software used
with the Licensed Program. For these reasons, Customer agrees to be solely responsible for the design, repair, and
configuration of Customer’s equipment, machinery, systems, and/or products. Customer assumes all risks and
liability for results obtained by the use of and/or implementation of the designs developed by Customer that are in
any way influenced by the use of the Licensed Program(s) or the provision of services, whether such designs are used
singly or in combination with other designs or products. Customer shall protect, indemnify, hold harmless, and
defend Syncfusion of and from any loss, cost, damage, or expense, including attorneys’ fees, arising from any claim
asserted against Syncfusion that is in any way associated with the matters set forth in this Section 9.1.
9.2
Without limitation of Section 9.1 above, the liability of Syncfusion for any claim relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including claims of negligence or
claims of intellectual property infringement against Syncfusion, shall be limited to the total of all amounts Customer
has paid to Syncfusion for the Licensed Program(s) or services that are finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have caused damages or that are related to the cause of action. The limitation of liability hereunder
shall be further limited to the amounts received by Syncfusion from Customer in the twelve (12) month period
preceding the date that Customer provides Syncfusion with written notice of such claim. In no event shall Syncfusion
be liable for any incidental, indirect, exemplary, special, or consequential damages including, without limitation, loss
of use, loss of profits, or other consequential damages, even if Syncfusion has been advised of the possibility of such
damages. No action, regardless of form, relating to the transactions under this Agreement may be brought by
Customer more than one (1) year after the event giving rise to the cause of action has occurred. For the avoidance of
doubt, Syncfusion assumes no liability whatsoever under any circumstances that may arise from a claim of patent
infringement against Customer or a licensee of Customer’s products.

9.3
Customer acknowledges and agrees that Syncfusion disclaims and therefore accepts no liability, in any form,
for any claim relating to any open source software. Further, Customer acknowledges and agrees that Syncfusion
shall have no liability, in any form, for any data loss caused by Customer’s use of any open source software in any
manner or form.
10.

Maintenance and Support:

10.1
Maintenance and Support services are included under all project licenses, division licenses, and global
licenses. For all Retail Licenses and other non-subscription licenses, Maintenance and Support services subscriptions
are available from Syncfusion for an additional charge. Maintenance and Support services subscriptions are provided
in accordance with the terms of Syncfusion’s then-current support and maintenance policies. A current version of
those policies is available from Syncfusion upon request. In the event that Customer declines to purchase and initiate
Maintenance and Support services subscriptions at the time of installation of the Licensed Program, or in the event
that Customer allows Maintenance and Support service coverage to lapse for any period of time, Customer agrees
that (i) Maintenance and Support service fees will be due, upon the resumption of Maintenance and Support services,
for any period during which Customer previously declined to purchase Maintenance and Support services; and (ii)
Customer must pay an upgrade fee to update the Licensed Program(s) to the then-latest version. Failure to maintain
a Maintenance and Support services subscription will limit Customer’s right to use the Licensed Programs to create
and re-distribute modified binaries for Customer’s product(s) as set forth in Section 4.2(f).
10.2
Syncfusion requires that each copy of the Licensed Program be assigned to an individual End-User for the
purpose of efficiently providing Maintenance and Support services. Accordingly, Customer acknowledges and
agrees that it will be required to provide information to Syncfusion that Syncfusion reasonably requests to identify
each individual End-User in order for Syncfusion to provide such Maintenance and Support services under a
Maintenance and Support services subscription.
10.3
In certain instances, Customer may have properly obtained Retail Licenses rather than a site license or an
enterprise license, but subsequent to the procurement of such Retail Licenses, Customer’s actual use of the Licensed
Programs may increase to the extent that a project license, site license, division license, or a global license is more
appropriate. Accordingly, Syncfusion reserves the right to make a determination as to whether or not the provision
of a Maintenance and Support services subscription for existing Retail Licenses continues to be appropriate under
the circumstances applicable to any given Customer, and reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to require a given
Customer to procure a project license, site license, division license, or global license for the continuation of such
Maintenance and Support services subscriptions for such previously procured Retail Licenses. For the avoidance of
doubt, Syncfusion reserves the right to refuse to renew any given Maintenance and Support services subscription at
its sole discretion.
10.4
Syncfusion reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to limit or suspend the provision of services under a
Maintenance and Support services subscription in the event that Syncfusion determines that Customer is abusing its
Maintenance and Support services subscription. Examples of such abuse include, but are not limited to, (i) Customer
personnel making excessive use of Syncfusion support resources, (ii) Customer personnel making unreasonable
demands of Syncfusion support personnel, (iii) Customer maintaining a number of Maintenance and Support services
subscriptions that is fewer than the number of Licensed Products originally licensed or that is currently in use by
Customer’s personnel, or (iv) Customer maintaining only a single or small number of valid Retail License(s) for a
given Licensed Product while allowing multiple End-Users to share fixes and support services obtained by other EndUsers.
10.5
Maintenance and Support services are provided to Customer only, and a Maintenance and Support services
subscription is valid only between Customer and Syncfusion. Accordingly, all help tickets, or route maintenance and
support requests, must be submitted by Customer and may not be submitted by any third party on behalf of Customer.
This prohibition against the use of third parties includes, but is not limited to, (i) Customer’s use of a third party to
submit help tickets on Customer’s behalf, (ii) Customer submitting a help ticket on behalf of a third party, (iii)
Customer using a third party to submit a request for support. Further, Customer cannot use any third party to provide
maintenance, support, or updates to the Licensed Product or any Customer product or other software application that
incorporates the Licensed Product; all Maintenance and Support services must be obtained directly from, and only

from, Syncfusion. Customer acknowledges that any breach of this Section 10.5 will constitute a material breach of
this Agreement and will result in an immediate termination of the license granted hereunder.
11.
Confidentiality and Proprietary Rights:
11.1
Syncfusion’s privacy policy and Syncfusion’s cookie policy are incorporated, by reference, into this
agreement.
11.2
Under no circumstances will Syncfusion request, nor does Syncfusion knowingly accept, any information
that can or could be considered to constitute personally identifiable information (“PII”) under any law or statute.
Syncfusion provides no protection, no indemnity, and no guarantees or warranty, of any kind, if You provide PII to
Syncfusion. You further acknowledge and agree that if you send PII to Syncfusion, Syncfusion will treat any such
disclosure as a material breach of this Agreement.
11.3
Information and data supplied by either party to the other party may include confidential or proprietary
information. Confidential or proprietary information (“Confidential Information”) means any information or data
(including without limitation any formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process) that
is disclosed by one party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other party (the “Receiving Party”) pursuant to this
Agreement. Confidential Information of Syncfusion includes, but is not limited to, the terms of this Agreement, the
Licensed Product, the Licensed Programs, the structure, organization, design, algorithms, methods, templates, data
models, data structures, flow charts, logic flow, and screen displays associated with the Licensed Program(s), the
Documentation, and pricing information. Confidential Information of Customer includes, but is not limited to,
Customer’s financial and business information. Confidential Information shall not include information that either
party can demonstrate: (i) at the time of disclosure is in the public domain or is otherwise available to the Receiving
Party other than on a confidential basis; (ii) after disclosure, becomes a part of the public domain by publication or
otherwise through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) was disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party not under
an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; or (iv) is or has been independently developed by the
Receiving Party (as evidenced by the Receiving Party’s written records) without access to any Confidential
Information of the Disclosing Party.
11.4
Each party agrees: (i) to hold the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in strict confidence; and
(ii) except as expressly authorized by this Agreement, not to, directly or indirectly, use, disclose, copy, transfer, or
allow access to the Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Receiving Party may disclose
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as required by law or court order; in such event, however, such party
shall if legally permitted inform the other party via telephone, email, or facsimile within a reasonable period of time
and, in all events, limit the extent of any such compelled disclosure to the minimum so required.
12.
Export: Customer acknowledges that the Licensed Product, including the Licensed Assemblies, provided
hereunder may be subject to the export control laws, rules, regulations, restrictions, and national security controls of
the United States and other applicable foreign agencies (the “Export Controls”). Customer agrees to abide by the
Export Controls, and that any Licensed Product and Licensed Assemblies licensed hereunder will not be exported (or
re-exported from the country where it was first installed), directly or indirectly, separately or as part of a system, sold,
leased, or otherwise transferred without Customer, at its own cost, first obtaining all necessary licenses from the
United States Department of Commerce and any other appropriate agency of the United States Government as may
be required by law. Customer acknowledges that it shall be solely responsible for determining the extent of any such
licenses required, and for any costs associated with complying with the requirements of this Section 12. Customer
hereby (i) represents and warrants that Customer is not an entity or person to which shipment of the Licensed Product
or provision of the Maintenance and Support services, is prohibited by the Export Controls; and (ii) agrees that it
shall not export, re-export, or otherwise transfer the Licensed Product to (a) any country subject to a United States
trade embargo, (b) a national or resident of any country subject to a United States trade embargo, (c) any person or
entity to which shipment of the Licensed Product is prohibited by the Export Controls, or (d) anyone who is engaged
in activities related to the design, development, production, or use of nuclear materials, nuclear facilities, nuclear
weapons, missiles, or chemical or biological weapons. Customer shall, at its expense, defend Syncfusion and its
affiliates from any third party claim or action arising out of any inaccurate representation made by Customer regarding
the existence of an export license, Customer’s failure to provide information to Syncfusion to obtain an export license,
or any allegation made against Syncfusion due to Customer’s violation or alleged violation of the Export Controls

(an “Export Claim”) and shall pay any judgments or settlements reached in connection with the Export Claim as
well as Syncfusion’s costs of responding to any such Export Claim.
13.
Government Contracting: If the Licensed Product is used in connection with providing goods and/or
services to the United States government or other government agency or entity contracting or subcontracting services,
Customer shall ensure that no government agency or entity shall acquire any rights of any nature in the Licensed
Program(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer may freely license its Customer products that include Licensed
Assemblies subject to Customer’s compliance with all of the limitations set forth in this Agreement.
14.
Taxes: The License Fees and any other amounts payable pursuant to the terms and conditions herein are
exclusive of all national, state, regional, local, municipal, or other taxes and fees including, but not limited to, excise,
sales, use, property, ad valorem, intangibles, goods and services and value added taxes, customs duties, and
registration fees now in force or enacted in the future, and all such taxes and fees, except taxes based on Syncfusion’s
net worth, capital, or net income, shall be paid directly by the Customer, or if paid by Syncfusion, Customer will
reimburse Syncfusion.
15.
Notice: Any notice or other communication given hereunder shall be in writing. Notice shall be considered
delivered and effective upon receipt when sent by U.S. Mail, postage prepaid, or certified mail, return receipt
requested, addressed to the parties as set forth above. Either party, upon written notice to the other, may change any
name or address to which future notice shall be sent.
16.

Audit:

16.1
General Audit: Customer shall prepare and maintain, in accordance with sound, generally accepted
accounting practices, complete and accurate books of account and records (specifically including, without limitation,
the originals or copies of documents supporting entries in the books of account) covering all transactions arising out
of or relating to this Agreement. Syncfusion, and at its discretion its duly authorized independent certified public
accountant, shall have the right, no more than twice per calendar year, during regular business hours, during the
period of time that Customer possesses any copy of the Licensed Product, and for two (2) years thereafter, to audit
said books of account and records and examine all other documents and materials in the possession or under the
control of Customer with respect to the subject matter and the terms of this Agreement. All such books of account,
records, and documents shall be kept available by customer for at least two (2) years after the last copy of the Licensed
Product has been deleted or destroyed and certification of the same has been provided to Syncfusion. If the result of
any audit of Customer’s books and records demonstrates that Customer’s payments were less than the amount which
should have been paid, Customer shall make payment of any discrepancy revealed by said audit within fifteen (15)
days after Syncfusion’s demand therefore and, if the discrepancy is in amount equal to three percent (3%) or more of
the payments made with respect to payments due hereunder, Customer shall reimburse Syncfusion for the cost of
such audit.
16.2
Under-licensing / Verification of End-Users: As set forth in Section 4.2 above, each individual End-User
must have an assigned copy of the Licensed Product. Syncfusion reserves the sole right to make a determination as
to how many End-Users a Customer has, and to require Customer to obtain additional copies of the Licensed Product
if in Syncfusion’s sole opinion Customer was previously under-licensed. In addition, the cost of a Maintenance and
Support Services subscription is dependent upon the number of End-Users that exist at the time such Maintenance
and Support Services subscription is renewed. Therefore, Customer acknowledges and agrees that it must cooperate
with Syncfusion in providing whatever information Syncfusion reasonably requires in order to determine the size of
Customer’s development teams without necessitating that Syncfusion make on on-site audit as allowed under Section
16.1 above. Failure to provide such cooperation is a material breach under this Agreement that is not subject to cure,
and Syncfusion reserves the right to immediately and without further notice terminate all rights licensed under this
Agreement for such breach.
17.
General:
17.1
Customer may not assign any of its obligations, rights, or remedies hereunder and any such attempted
assignment shall be null and void.

ESSENTIAL STUDIO SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
17.2
The waiver or failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be
deemed a waiver of any further right hereunder. This Agreement constitutes the complete understanding between
the parties with respect to the subject matter herein and supersedes all proposals, all previous negotiations and
agreements, written or oral, express or implied, between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein. This
Agreement may not be waived, altered, amended, or modified except in writing, directly referencing the Agreement,
and signed by authorized representatives of both parties.
17.3
It is expressly agreed that the parties are acting hereunder as independent contractors. Under no
circumstances shall any of the employees of one party act on behalf of, or be deemed the employees of, the other
party for any purpose.
17.4
Syncfusion shall have the right, but no obligation, to use Customer’s name and Customer’s logo in a list of
Syncfusion’s licensees. Such list of licensees will only identify Customer by name and/or logo, but will not make
any statement about the relationship between Syncfusion and Customer without Customer’s permission. Syncfusion
will remove Customer’s name from any such list upon sixty (60) days’ written notice from Customer.
17.5
Customer acknowledges and agrees that Syncfusion shall have the right, but no obligation, to provide
communication to the Customer, in multiple forms, to include email, without a violation of any email regulation or
law, including but not limited to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 or similar laws and/or regulations. Customer may opt
out of receiving marketing emails by contacting sales@syncfusion.com.
17.6
If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other part or provision of this
Agreement.
17.7
The obligations of Customer under Sections 5, 11, 12 and 13 hereof are of a special and unique character
which gives them a peculiar value to Syncfusion and its Vendors for which neither Syncfusion nor its Vendors can
be reasonably or adequately compensated in damages in the event Customer breaches such obligations. Therefore,
Syncfusion and its Vendors shall, in addition to other remedies which may be available, each be entitled to injunctive
and other equitable relief in the event of the breach or threatened breach of such obligations.
17.8
Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled
by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The
number of arbitrators shall be three (3), with one (1) arbitrator being named by each party and the third arbitrator
being chosen by the other two (2) arbitrators. The place of arbitration shall be Raleigh, North Carolina, and the laws
of North Carolina shall apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof.
17.9
This Agreement shall be governed by the substantive laws of the state of North Carolina without regard to
any conflict of law provisions. This Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention of Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods, or by the Uniform Commercial Code, the application of which is expressly
excluded. The parties agree that sole jurisdiction and venue for any dispute relating to this Agreement shall be in a
federal or state court located in Wake County, North Carolina.
17.10
This Agreement shall be binding on you by your clicking on the “YES” button. If the parties hereto execute
this Agreement in writing by an exchange of faxed signed copies hereof, it shall be binding by such exchange of
signed copies. In the event of such an exchange, this Agreement shall become binding on both parties and shall
constitute admissible evidence of the existence and binding effect of this Agreement.
17.11
The terms and conditions of this Agreement apply to any and all Vendor software included with or
imbedded in the Licensed Program(s).
